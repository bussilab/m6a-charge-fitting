This repository contains sample notebooks and input files to two manuscripts:

- [Molecular Simulations Matching Denaturation Experiments for N6-Methyladenosine](https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.2c00565), also available as [arXiv:2203.14886](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14886). Trajectory files, as well as all input files used for molecular dynamics simulations, can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/6498021).
- Molecular simulations to investigate the impact of N6-methylation in RNA recognition: Improving accuracy and precision of binding free energy prediction, submitted, also available as [arXiv:2404.14821](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14821). Trajectory files, as well as all input files used for molecular dynamics simulations, can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11002097). PLUMED input files are also shared on the [PLUMED-NEST](https://www.plumed-nest.org) [![plumID:24.012](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/24/012/badge.svg)](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/24/012/)
